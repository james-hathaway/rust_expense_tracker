# rust_expense_tracker

This basic expense tracker helped me learn many basic programming concepts, but instead of an object-oriented java setting I learned
various points of Rust syntax and abilities that I was not used to from working in Java.

From working on this project, I learned about using a "loop" controller, which I had never used before. This is interesting as it is similar to a 
while loop, but it has its benefits. I chose a loop opposed to a while loop for user convenience. I also learned about using vectors, which are very
similar to arrays in Java (from what I understand!) with some of their own niche uses as well. 

I enjoyed the usage of the match statement within the loop, as I felt it was an elegant way to allow for these different types of options. Using struct 
to represent an expense as I would do in Java with a class felt quite normal to me. Overall, this waas fun and can actually be quite useful!
